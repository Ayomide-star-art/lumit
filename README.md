# Lumit

Lumit is an interactive learning platform that turns documents into conversations. Users upload learning materials such as PDFs or lecture notes and choose an animated character to guide them through the content. The chosen character explains concepts, answers questions in real time, and adapts explanations to the user’s age and knowledge level.

Lumit is built to be inclusive. The platform provides sign language avatar output for learners who are deaf or hard of hearing and supports intuitive interfaces for those with speech impairments. Multilingual support allows users to select regional and standard language variations, including English, Yoruba, French, Spanish, and others.

Lumit matters because learning should be engaging and accessible. In many contexts, study is solitary, passive, and difficult to retain. Lumit brings curiosity and interaction back to learning, serving children, teenagers, university students, professionals, and learners with disabilities. The platform aims to make lessons memorable and to boost understanding and retention through personalized, character-driven explanations.
